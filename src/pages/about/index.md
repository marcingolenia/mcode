My name is Marcin, I am living in Warsaw, Poland. I am a book consumer - not only related to techy things but also Fantasy and Sci-fi. I own two cats, and I am owned by my wife who professionally does the Business intelligence stuff.

Besides, when I realize that I should lose some weight (this happens few times per year) I try to reach half-marathon distance by running each time starting over and over again (the current record is 20km - almost!).

### Career

Currently, I am a full-stack software engineer working at Rydoo. I also worked for big corporations, banks, software houses, outsourcing agencies. I am living mostly in .Net related world. Thankfully Microsoft strategy changed a little bit (cross-platform and open-source techs) so I am still with them. C#, F#, Typescript but also sometimes pure JS, MSSQL but also Postgres, MongoDB, Rabbit, Docker, and some more. I am also a fan of TDD, DDD and DevOps guy.

### Personal views on software development

I can't imagine going back to non-DevOps culture or not doing TDD. I should write some posts concerning this topics shortly.

I see big value in functional programming (immutable data structures, concise and exact code thanks to types, records, unions, techniques like partial application). There is a drawback, however - you can't easily find a functional dev job (at least in Poland). You have to create that place in your company. 

I don't like the microservices hype... that might be controversial but that's how it is. I do them sometimes but only when the value that they bring is greater then the complexity cost. What I do like is a modular monolith and extracting the "modules" to microservices when needed.

I also don't like the current shape of agile stuff in our industry - again controversial. But agile has lost its way. I  appreciate the agile software development manifesto, the values that scrum brings, extreme programming, using kanban, etc... but in reality we have buzz-word "agile" and army of high-cost agile-advising companies, certification, unskilled scrum masters. This simply has to change.

More will come in blog posts...
