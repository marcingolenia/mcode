My name is Martin, currently I am living in Warsaw, Poland. I am book consumer - not only related to techy things but also Fantasy and Sci-fi. I own two cats, and I am owned by my wife who profesionally does the Business intellegicence stuff.

Currently I am reading (I try do update this list once per month):

* The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition
* Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
* Developer Hegemony: The Future of Labor

Besides when I realize that it I should loose some weight (this happens few times per year) I try to reach half-marathon distance by running each time starting over and over again (current record is 20km - almost!).

### Career

Currently I am full-stack software engineer working at Rydoo. I also worked for big coorporations, banks, software house, outsourcing agencies. I am living mostly in .Net related world. Thankfully Microsoft strategy changed a little bit (cross-platform and open source techs) so I am still with them. C#, F#, Typescript but also sometimes pure JS, MS Sql but also postgres, mongodb, Rabbit, Docker and some more. I am also fan of TDD, DDD and devops guy.

### Personal views on software development

I can't imagine going back to non-devops culture or not doing TDD. I should write some posts about this in near future.

I see big value in functional programming (immutable data structures, concise and exact code thanks to types, records, unions, techniques like partial application). There is a drawback however - you can't easily find a functional dev job (at least in Poland). You have to create that place in your company. 

I don't like the microservices hype... that might be controversial but that's how it is. I do them sometimes but only when the value that they bring is greater then the complexity cost. What I do like is modular monolith and extracing the "modules" to microservices when needed.

I also don't like the agile stuff - again controlversial. But agile has lost it way. I  appreciate the agile software development manifesto, the values that scrum brings, extreme programming, using kanban etc... but in reality we have buzz-word "agile" and army of high-cost agile-advising companies, certficates, unskilled scrum masters. This simply has to change.

More will come in blog posts...
