  title: Yet another IT blog?
  description: >
    There are already a lot of them so what makes this one special? Absolutely
    nothing! And that is just fine. I believe that every person has something
    important to say. I speak on my behalf on this blog, feel free to quote,
    love or hate. I write about programming, architecture, infrastructure and
    organizational things.

  My name is Marcin. I have been working in the IT industry for 9+ years now.
  It's been a quite fun and hard ride. in 2020 I've decided to start sharing
  with others - there were too many things that I have been keeping for myself,
  too much worries, too much silent disagreements to on what's going on in the IT
  nowadays. Time to wake up! Check out "about" tab if you want to know a
  bit more about me.
