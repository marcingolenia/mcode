  How do you approach integration with 3rd party services? How do you learn new API which you have to use? Do you write a console app, run and stop it over and over again? If you write a service which will be used by others do you write documentation? Stop wasting time! Learning tests will help you speed up.

## 1. Introduction
The idea of learning tests is old - I have read about it for the first time in Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. Quite an important classic book isn't it? The chapter with learning tests is very short but don't get it wrong it doesn't mean that this idea is not important it is just easy to explain. I needed a few years to start writing them, the funny thing is that once I started doing it, I cannot stop it! And I will tell you why.

## 2. What are these tests? Why you think they are so precious?

## 3. Should this be part of CI?

## 4. Ok cool... but can you give me some real examples?

## 5. Summary
The learning tests prove to be a very useful tool many times for me. I am wondering why they are so rare? I mean I haven't seen them anywhere! Did you? I hope so. I hope I got you inspired and next time when you will have to integrate with the next service you will do a spike with a learning test as a spike effect. It will help you to provide the good estimation to actual tasks and shine within the company when someone will ask... 
> Hey! Did someone already integrate with service X? Can someone help me?

Boom! 
> Sure! Please have a look at this test. Here's everything you need.
