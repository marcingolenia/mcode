title: 'Technology Radar as a knowledge and communication'

  A radar is a system that uses radio waves to find the position and movement of objects, for example, planes and ships, when they cannot be seen the. Analogously Technology radar "uses" engineers and built systems to find the position and movement of languages, platforms, tools and techniques in trends. In this post I will describe the radar as an actual need in company and lean perspective.

## 1. Motivation
At my current job couple months ago I had a rough discussion with CTO about the need of existence of an organisation structure named Architecture Board which was about to establish. Let's skip the *architecture* and *architect* words and let me focus on the problem that was adressed. The board was supposed to:
- Control used languages, frameworks, techniques.
- Track the *tech stuff* that was going on in different projects.
- Advise on architecture and hard technical problems.

Control and track was emphasized so I thought about Taylorism and its first step of social engineering which is the separation of planning and execution as well as the second one - creation of a separate quality depertment. You can read more about Taylorism and why it is bad for software engineering in [1]. Kent Beck in Extreme Programming also mentions Taylorism as non beneficial industrial approach for software. It was the architecture board that should be now responsible for taking important technical decisions without dealing with the consequences. I wish I could say I succeeded in negotations but I don't. Few things happened;
- I have denied being the member of the board - emphasizing that no one will better know the architecture than the team itself and informing that autonomy was a company selling point when I decided to take the job.
- I have prepared a short presentation about what "an architect" should do (referencing Martin Fowler, Uncle Bob, Sam Newman and Accelerate book).
- I have proposed creating dedicated well-named guilds that were grouped around specific problems like "performance", "security", "CI/CD" and so on. 

I also proposed that the CTO can talk about the architecture with the teams directly if he needs it. I was argued that he don't have spare time to talk with family. The talk was getting quite dirty (private reasons), double standards fallacy and so on so I gave up. The result is that the architecture board was born, I am not part of it and my team is fully autonomous with some limited standarization resulting from the company interest (like gold Microsoft partnership). You might think about it like win-win situation (because I have freedom and CTO has the architecture board) but this is not leadersheap, you can't inspire others and have a vision by having peace of mind. 

After a while I have a chat with my friend about the whole situation and I've mentioned technology radar. It turned out he didn't know this concept when I gave some explanations he gave an idea that this could replace the whole "track" need of the CTO. That make me think... In result I dived more into the topic. I decided to share with you what I have found and concluded putting the radar in the light of Lean - maybe you will be in simillar situation and with this blog post you will handle the situation better than me. That said... I hope I will counterattack in comming days.

## 2. History of Technology Radar

## 3. A side note.

## Summary
I strongly believe that properly running a technology radar creates effective communication based on feedback that replaces the need of centralized control in organistation structure. Find a small mindmap which I have created in prepartion to write this post: 

Notice that TaughtWorks and other companies had the radar for internal use first. That is something we should understand - there is no silver bullet - one technology can be something to "Adopt" in one context and "Hold" in another context. If you already looked into the TaughtWorks radar you have an answer why the "adopt" part is so small numbered. Even the techs are in the adopt circle remember - TaughtWorks have also the projects scope limited. Look for inspirations with other companies but always put your needs first.
