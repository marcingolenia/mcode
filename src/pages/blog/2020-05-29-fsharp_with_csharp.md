description: >-
   F# is a nice functional alternative in .NET. I have convinced my teammates to use F# in our project at my work in a small new accounting bounded context that would be hosted by .NET Core C# host and Autofac based composition root. We already have a small F# based azure-function which has been a warm-welcomed area to extend / introduce changes so why not take F# to the next level? If you are looking for some hints how to deal with F# and C# in one solution this is a must-read.
